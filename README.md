    I was lucky enough to get into IT by learning Java, even though I hadn't written Java code in a long time. But I am still learning new knowledge and practicing.
    I'm a self learner,  front-end technology and Linux have always fascinated me, and I've believed from the beginning that everything will eventually run in the browser.
    Almost all of my work experience came from Microsoft's Azure cloud architecture solution. So most of my learning resources also come from Microsoft.
    I'm an idealist. My dream is to be a hacker, a musician or a poet. Anyway, I'm just a corporate slave now.
